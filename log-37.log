Asking ChatGPT:
I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
The error is of the type of "DEREFERENCE_NULLABLE" and the full error message is: "dereferenced expression this.shutdownThread is @Nullable".
The line with the error is: "			this.shutdownThread.interrupt();".

The error is within "the method: abort()" and the code surrounding the error is:
```java
			server.disposeNow(Duration.ofNanos(Long.MAX_VALUE));
			logger.info("Graceful shutdown complete");
			callback.shutdownComplete(GracefulShutdownResult.IDLE);
		}
		catch (Exception ex) {
			logger.info("Graceful shutdown aborted with one or more requests still active");
			callback.shutdownComplete(GracefulShutdownResult.REQUESTS_ACTIVE);
		}
		finally {
			this.shutdownThread = null;
			this.shuttingDown = false;
		}
	}

	void abort() {
		Thread shutdownThread = this.shutdownThread;
		if (shutdownThread != null) {
			while (!this.shuttingDown) {
				sleep(50);
			}
			this.shutdownThread.interrupt();
		}
	}

	private void sleep(long millis) {
		try {
			Thread.sleep(millis);
		}
		catch (InterruptedException ex) {
			Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
		}
	}

}
```

Give me the fixed code snippet (ONLY THE METHOD REWRITE OF "abort()") in XML format in <response> tag like the example below. I will apply the fix to my codebase.
Do not import any additional libraries or classes or java comments.
If you can provide the fixed code snippet, provide it in the following format and place the code snippet in the <code> tag within ```java block.
<response>
  <success>true</success>
  <code><![CDATA[
