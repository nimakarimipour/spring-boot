Asking ChatGPT:
In the method below, is there a possibility that the expression "this.shutdownThread" at line "this.shutdownThread.interrupt();" is null?
void abort() {
		Thread shutdownThread = this.shutdownThread;
		if (shutdownThread != null) {
			while (!this.shuttingDown) {
				sleep(50);
			}
			this.shutdownThread.interrupt();
		}
}
Give a single-word answer in XML format. If it is possible for the expression to be null, respond with:
```xml
<response>
    <reason><![CDATA[YOUR REASON]]></reason>
    <value>YES</value>
</response>
```
If it is not possible for the expression to be null, respond with:
```xml
<response>
    <reason><![CDATA[YOUR REASON]]></reason>
    <value>NO</value>
</response>
```
If you are unsure or need more information, respond with where you can ask for more details or what specific information you need.

If additional information is required, list each request inside a `<request>` tag. If no additional information is needed, omit the `<requests>` section.

Respond with:
```xml

Asking ChatGPT:
For the reason you mentioned earlier:

"The variable "shutdownThread" is assigned with "this.shutdownThread" at the beginning of the method and is checked for null right after. The expression "this.shutdownThread" used later refers to the same variable that has already been verified as non-null in the if condition. Therefore, it is not possible for "this.shutdownThread" to be null at the point it is used."

in the method below, the expression this.shutdownThread is not nullable at the point it is used.

```java
void abort() {
		Thread shutdownThread = this.shutdownThread;
		if (shutdownThread != null) {
			while (!this.shuttingDown) {
				sleep(50);
			}
			this.shutdownThread.interrupt();
		}
}
```
Please Summarize the reason in max 5 words and rewrite the method so that at the line "			this.shutdownThread.interrupt();", at the occurrence of: "this.shutdownThread" is replaced with `Nullability.castToNonnull(this.shutdownThread, summary of reason)`
Replace "REASON" with the exact reason summary I provide to you (maximum 5 words), not with a generic explanation like "checked to be nonnull".
see the example below, for expression `foo.getBar()`, to wrap it with `Nullability.castToNonnull(foo.getBar(), "reason")`.

```java
public t(){
    String l = foo.getBar();
}
```

will be:
```java
public t(){
    String l = Nullability.castToNonnull(foo.getBar(), "checked to be nonnull");
}
```

### Instructions:

Do not import any additional classes.

Do not add Java comments.

Only modify relevant lines as required.

Return only the modified method wrapped in the XML format shown below.

Place the Java code inside the <code> tag using a CDATA block with ```java formatting.

Just give me the fixed code snippet in XML format in <response> tag like the example below. I will apply the fix to my codebase. Do not import any additional libraries or classes or add java comments. If you can provide the fixed code snippet, please provide it in the following format and place the code snippet in the <code> tag within ```java block.
