Asking ChatGPT:
I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
The error is of the type of "ASSIGN_FIELD_NULLABLE" and the full error message is: "assigning @Nullable expression to @NonNull field".
The line with the error is: "		this.destinationSupplier = null;".

The error is within "the method: DeferredLog()" and the code surrounding the error is:
```java
/**
 * Deferred {@link Log} that can be used to store messages that shouldn't be written until
 * the logging system is fully initialized.
 *
 * @author Phillip Webb
 * @since 1.3.0
 */
public class DeferredLog implements Log {

	@Nullable
	private volatile Log destination;

	private final Supplier<Log> destinationSupplier;

	private final Lines lines;

	/**
	 * Create a new {@link DeferredLog} instance.
	 */
	public DeferredLog() {
		this.destinationSupplier = null;
		this.lines = new Lines();
	}

	/**
	 * Create a new {@link DeferredLog} instance managed by a {@link DeferredLogFactory}.
	 * @param destination the switch-over destination
	 * @param lines the lines backing all related deferred logs
	 * @since 2.4.0
	 */
	DeferredLog(Supplier<Log> destination, Lines lines) {
		Assert.notNull(destination, "Destination must not be null");
		this.destinationSupplier = destination;
		this.lines = lines;
	}

	@Override
	public boolean isTraceEnabled() {
		synchronized (this.lines) {
			return (this.destination == null) || this.destination.isTraceEnabled();
```

Give me the fixed code snippet (ONLY THE METHOD REWRITE OF "DeferredLog()") in XML format in <response> tag like the example below. I will apply the fix to my codebase.
Do not import any additional libraries or classes or java comments.
If you can provide the fixed code snippet, provide it in the following format and place the code snippet in the <code> tag within ```java block.
<response>
  <success>true</success>
  <code><![CDATA[
