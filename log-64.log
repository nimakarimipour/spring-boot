Asking ChatGPT:
In the method below, is there a possibility that the method returns null based only on its body? Consider the following points:

- The method may have multiple return paths; consider all return statements.
- If the method calls another method, do not assume its return value unless its full declaration is provided. Request its declaration if needed.
- The method may throw an exception instead of returning null. An exception path should not be considered a null return.
- Ensure you request the declarations of any methods whose return values directly or indirectly impact this method’s return value before making a conclusion.
- Carefully analyze all conditions and prior operations that may guarantee a non-null return value.

@Nullable
	@Override
	public InetSocketAddress address() {
		if (this.channel != null) {
			return this.channel.address();
		}
		return null;
}

Here are the method definitions in addition to the method inquired:

	@Override
	public InetSocketAddress address() {
		if (this.channel != null) {
			return this.channel.address();
		}
		return null;
}
}
```


Response Format:
Provide the answer in **XML format** as follows:

#### If the method **cannot** return `null`:
```xml
<response>
  <reason><![CDATA[EXPLAIN WHY THE METHOD CANNOT RETURN NULL]]></reason>
  <value>NO</value>
</response>
```

#### If the method can return null:
```xml
<response>
  <reason><![CDATA[EXPLAIN WHY THE METHOD CAN RETURN NULL]]></reason>
  <value>YES</value>
</response>
```

#### If you are unsure or need more information, respond with where you can ask for more details or what specific information you need.

#### If you are unsure or If there are any methods that directly or indirectly affect the return value and are not fully disclosed, request their declarations first, in the following format:
<response>
  <reason><![CDATA[YOUR REASON]]></reason>
  <value>UNKNOWN</value>
  <methods>
    <method>methodName</method>
  </methods>
</response>

If additional information is required other than method declaration, list each request inside a `<request>` tag. If no additional information is needed, omit the `<requests>` section.

Respond with:
```xml
<response>
    <reason><![CDATA[YOUR REASON]]></reason>
    <value>UNKNOWN</value>
    <!-- Include <requests> only if additional information is needed -->
    <requests>

        <request><![CDATA[YOUR REQUEST 2]]></request>
    </requests>

Additional Notes:
Be precise in your reasoning.
If a method’s return value depends on another method not provided, request its declaration before making a conclusion.
If the method can return null in some cases but not others, explain under what conditions it can happen.

I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
I am getting the error that in line: 		logger.info("Netty RSocket started on port(s): " + address().getPort());, the dereferenced expression address() is @Nullable and can produce Null Pointer Exception. In the method below:
@Override
	public void start() throws RSocketServerException {
		this.channel = block(this.starter, this.lifecycleTimeout);
		logger.info("Netty RSocket started on port(s): " + address().getPort());
		startDaemonAwaitThread(this.channel);
}
I am going to show you a couple of other examples in my codebase where the dereferenced expression is used in a way that cannot produce Null Pointer Exception.
Here are the examples(s):
@Nullable @Override
	public InetSocketAddress address() {
		if (this.channel != null) {
			return this.channel.address();
		}
		return null;
}
@Nullable
	InetSocketAddress address()
}
Given the examples above, I want you to fix the error in the original method by using the same pattern as in the examples.
If you can fix the error, please provide the fixed code snippet in XML format. I just need the XML response, no other information is needed. If you can provide the fixed code snippet, please provide it in the following format and place the code snippet in the <code> tag within ```java block.
